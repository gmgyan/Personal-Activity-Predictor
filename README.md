Predicting Personal Activities using data from smart fitness devices
=====================================================================

### Introduction:

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. The goal of this project is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This prediction model used to predict on 20 different test cases.

### Background:

With the advent of smart devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, Fitbit, Smart Watches etc., it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. So, in this project we will try to predict excercing patterns of the participants.
